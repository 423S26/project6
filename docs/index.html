        <h2>User Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            The word processor creates, edits, formats, stores and prints text based documents. It’s unique because it is secure and HIPAA compliant to prevent leaks of confidential patient information. Our client wants it to make documentation streamlined and secure, the client also wants to share the documents with clients and other individuals related to the patient (e.g. the patient’s parents) since they like seeing the notes our client takes.
